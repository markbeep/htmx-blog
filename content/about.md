Hello, I'm Mark. Currently in my bachelor of computer science at ETH Zurich. I like to code a lot.
You'll never see me without tons of projects on the side. I have too many projects I wanna do, but not
enough time to work on them all. Friends usually ask "What projects are you working on?" instead of
"How's studying going?"

Languages I consider myself fluent in are Python, C and Typescript. I like to create bare metal and fast applications
with C but I also enjoy working on cool websites with React.js on Typescript.

Lately, I've also worked a lot with Docker and Kubernetes. Docker is my favorite tool right now and
I usually try to deploy all my applications with a Dockerfile or docker-compose file so that I can
then easily deploy it on my Kubernetes cluster. Also makes it a lot easier for anyone to run it on different
devices.
