Install `go1.21` and `go install github.com/cosmtrek/air@latest`

Then simply start the project by running `air` which enables hot reload

Or simply run `go run .` like a normie.

## Best development setup

With `air`, you can simply run `air` in the root directory to have hot-reload enabled.

Additionally get `tailwindcss` and run `tailwindcss -i static/tw.css -o static/main.css --watch` for it to automatically build the new `main.css` file.
